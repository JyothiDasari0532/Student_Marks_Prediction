Project Title:
Student Marks Prediction using Machine Learning

Project Description:
This project is a simple Machine Learning application that predicts student marks based on the number of hours studied. The system uses the Linear Regression algorithm to learn the relationship between study hours and marks. After training the model, the user can enter the number of hours they studied, and the model will predict the expected marks. This project helps understand the basics of AI and Machine Learning concepts in a practical way.

Problem Statement
Students often want to know how their study time affects their performance. Manually calculating results is not accurate. This project solves this problem by using Machine Learning to predict marks based on study hours.
